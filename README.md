# Portfolio website
## Introduction
Hello, My name is Malcolm. I am a current student at Maryville University for my MS in artficial intelligence. I have my BS in computer science  with a concentration in Data Science and Artificial Inteligence. This website will be my portfolio to show the projects I have worked on throughout the years and currently. Most of my projects will be shown on github as I add them in and work through them.  

## Skills
I have a background in programming with Python, R, C++, java, and used a reference to create this website via [HTML5UP](https://html5up.net/).  

I have learned so far using git and the command line to properly clone my repository and proceed locally with my changes. Then I can use git to then add the changes and commmit them.
